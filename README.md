# sdbox for Amiga

### A parallel to sd-card project for the Amiga

This code uses the code from the amiga-par-to-spi-adapter https://github.com/niklasekstrom/amiga-par-to-spi-adapter written by Niklas Ekstr√∂m. KiCad design, Schematics and files for DesignSpark Mechanical v4 is made by me. Design of the 3d-printable sdbox case is made by me and Tobias Niva (niva3d, http://www.niva3d.com/). It is a collaborative work done by us three, Enjoy!

What is the sdbox for Amiga? 

It is a small device that you can plug into your Amiga's parallel port and get access to a sd-card formatted with e.g. a windows FAT file system. It uses an Arduino Nano V3 and a common cheap MicroSD Card Adapter that has a voltage level shifter on board. These small devices are soldered onto a small PCB together with a male d-sub db25 connector that fits into the Amiga parallel port (The A1000 needs a proper gender changer, be aware). The device must be powered externally either through the usb-connector on the Nano or via the separate barrel jack connector on the main PCB. A power supply with 1A DC capacity should suffice. `5V` via USB or `7-12V` via the barrel jack power connector that goes to the VIN of the Nano V3. The driver should be AmigaOS system friendly but takes exclusive access over the parallel port so don't expect to run other things on this port together with the sdbox with some kind of breakout cable. It should work from 1.3 and upwards, not verified on all OS versions yet though.

The schematics, BOM, kicad drawings and the 3d-printable case source and stl files can all be found in the hardware folder.

PCBs can be order directly via link below or you can generate your own gerbers from the KiCad files and send them to your favorite boardhouse mfg.

### Caveats

One little caveat to keep in mind is that we do no CRC-checking of data being copied so please verify your files afterwards if you are going to copy important files over this way like taking a backup or something. Another caveat is that not all sd-cards might work with the sdbox so aim for a cheap 4/8 GB card and format it with a smaller partition `below 4GB` with FAT is a good starting point. If you see an error message saying `"bad number"` when trying to mount `SD0` it may be an indication that that particular card simply doesn't work with the sdbox for some reason.

Everything done here is provide `as is`, don't blame us if your Amiga CIAs dies or your files get corrupted using the sdbox. I don't think it will happen though. Be careful though when plugging the sdbox in or out of the Amiga, always do this with the Amiga turned off.

    Some advice from Tom Handley / 18 April 93 (taken from pario on Aminet)

    NEVER connect, disconnect, or switch, parallel port lines with the power on!  
    ALWAYS shut the power off first!  In most cases, you should use the following sequence:

       Power up:   - Turn on your Amiga
                   - Turn on the external device

       Power down: - Turn off the external device
                   - Turn off your Amiga
                   
    If you have been switching devices with the power on you have been lucky...
    Not following the above precaution, and static electricity, are the two main
    causes of user-induced 8520 failures.

### Kudos

Many thanks to Mike Stirling for writing the original k1208-drivers and making them open source, we built further on his code. It was a good starting point. Thanks Mike and Kipper2K and others involved in k1208.

### Performance 

What about performance you may ask? 

Well, Niklas managed to write the drivers with some real clever assembler to make it go at 2E-speed (theoretical 350 KB/s, IRL around 225 KB/s) if you have some kind of Accelerator installed in your A500. 
Copying a 23 MB file from the SD-card to the compact flash in the HC508 took 98 seconds, giving a throughput of 225 KB/s. We think this is a good result given the fact of the slow clocking of the CIAs (E-clock). It will also work with a standard 68k CPU at 7 MHz albeit slower.

Speed definition of 2E here: <br />

### Howto build the sdbox

Start with removing the angled pins from the MicroSD Card Adapter and replace with straight pins like on the pictures below:

Now we start soldering on the surface mount parts, the passives, also known as the bird seed :) Start with Q1 and Q2, they are tiny so you probably need som sort of magnification. I use a lamp with a built-in magnifier glas, it works well, I do not have a scope. Use a fine tip with your solder iron...

Now with the surface mount stuff done we do the through-hole stuff, solder on two cut-down pins as leg support for the MicroSD Card Adapter, the adapter will rest on these and make it in level and the same height as the Nano.

Now, with this type of connector the metal plate comes loose when you unscrew the connector nuts. We need to remove them because we don't want to remove them on the Amiga side. Use some super glue and a vice or similar to press them together a couple of minutes until the glue bites. Be quick if you use super glue! Then put the screws back while soldering, we want the metal pieces in there as a support taking some force off the pins when plugging the device in and out of the Amiga.

Almost done!, time to put the LEDs in. To get the correct LED height for the sdbox 3d-printable case, I used a leftover trial print of the bottom part and drilled a hole through it to give me access to tack the LEDs down, with the iron, while holding the LEDs in place pressing on the legs gently. Cut the legs like in the picture below so that you can remove the pcb from the case and solder and trim them better afterwards. Job done!

The Centronics interface on the Amiga should bring joy to any hacker's heart. It is completely PC compatible. Unfortunately, the Amiga 1000 Centronics port does not conform to the PC standard. First, a female connector was used instead of the usual male db25 connector, and second pin 23 is +5V instead of ground as it is usually on most printer cables. If such a cable is used with the A1000, a short occurs and the Amiga can be damaged.

Internally all the Centronics port lines (except for +5V and Reset) are connected directly to the port lines of the individual CIA's. The exact assignment are as follows:

The Centronics interface is a parallel interface. The data byte lies on the eight data lines. When the computer has placed a valid byte on the data lines it clears the STROBE line to 0 for 1.4 microseconds, signalling the printer that a valid byte is ready for it. The printer must then acknowledge this by pulling the Ack line low for at least one microsecond. The computer then place the next byte on the bus.

The printer uses the BUSY line to indicate that it is occupied and can not accept any more data at the moment. This occurs when the printer buffer is full, for example. The computer then waits until BUSY goes high again before it continues sending data. With the Paper Out line the printer tells the computer that it is out of paper. The select line is also controlled by the printer and indicates whether it is ONLINE (selected, SEL high) or OFFLINE (unselected, SEL low).

The Centronics port is well suited as a universal interface for connecting home-built expansions such as an audio digitizer or an EPROM burner, since almost all of the lines can be programmed to be either inputs or outputs.

The 8250 has the following features: two programmable 8-bit parallel ports (PA and PB), two 16-bit timers (A and B), a bidirectional serial port (SP) and a 24-bit counter (event counter) with an alarm function upon reaching a programmed value. All of the functions can generate interrupts.

The addresses `$BFE001` for CIA-A and `$BFD000` for CIA-B are the base of the CIAs specified by Commodore. The selection between the two CIAs is made with address line A12 and A13. CIA-A is selected when `A12=0` and CIA-B is selected when `A13=0`. Since the data bus of CIA-A is connected to processor data lines `D0-D7 (odd addresses)` and CIA-B to `D8-D15 (even addresses)`, the two can be accessed together in one word access if `A12` and `A13` are both 0.

The addressing scheme for the CIA's can be summarized as follows. CIA-A is selected by the following addresses (binary):

    101x xxxx xxx0 rrrr xxxx xxx1
    
and CIA-B by:

    101x xxxx xx0x rrrr xxxx xxx0
    
The function of the 8250 are organixed in 16 registers. The four bits designated rrrr select the corresponding registers. The various registers of the CIAs appear multiple times in the range from `$A00000` to `$BFFFFF`.  To the processor they look like ordinary memory locations, since all peripheral components in a 68000 system are memory mapped. The registers of a chip are accessed like memory locations.

The E clock on the 68000 is connected to the ‚åÄ2 input of the 8250. The 16 internal registers are selected with the four address inputs A0-A3. Here is a explanation of the 16 registers (actually only 15 registers, since register 11 is unsused):

### The parallel ports

    Reg.  Name  D7    D6    D5    D4    D3    D2    D1    D0
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    0     PA    PA7   PA6   PA5   PA4   PA3   PA2   PA1   PA0
    1     PB    PB7   PB6   PB5   PB4   PB3   PB2   PB1   PB0
    2     DDRA  DPA7  DPA6  DPA5  DPA4  DPA3  DPA2  DPA1  DPA0
    3     DDRB  DPB7  DPB6  DPB5  DPB4  DPB3  DPB2  DPB1  DPB0


The 8250 has two 8-bit parallel ports, PA and PB, each of which is assigned a data register. The chip has 16 port lines, PA0-PA7 and PB0-PB7. Each port line can be used as either an input or an output. The input or output of a port line is called the data direction. The 8250 allows the data direction of each line to be controlled individually. Each port has data direction registers, DDRA and DDRB. 

If a bit in the data direction register is 0, the corresponding line is an input. The state of the port lines can be determined by reading the appropriate bits of the data direction register. If a bit in DDR is set to 1, then the corresponding port line becomes an output.

In general, writing to the data registers always stores the value in it, while reading always returns the state of the port lines. The bits in the data registers is placed in the port lines. Therefore when reading the port which is configured as an output, the contents of the data register is returned, while when writing to an input the value is stored in the data register, but doesn't appear on the port lines until the port is configured as output.

To simplify the data transfer through the parallel ports, the 8250 has two handshake lines, PC and FLAG.

The PC output goes low for one clock period on each access to the data register B (PB, reg 1). The FLAG input responds to such downward transitions. Every time the state of the FLAG line changes from 1 to 0, the FLAG bit is set in the interrupt controller register (ICR, reg. $D). These two lines allow a simple handshaking in which the FLAG and PC lines of two CIA's are cross-connected.

The sender need only write its data to the port register and then wait for a FLAG signal before sending each additional byte. Since FLAG can generate an interrupt, the sender can even perform other tasks while it is waiting. The same applies to the receiver, except that it reads the data from the port instead of writing it.

The simplest way to program this interface is directly through the hardware registers. This has the disadvantage that problems can occur with multitasking if another program wants to access this interface, thus it is better to access it through Amiga DOS. The data format is then predefined but you lose the ability to program individual bits as inputs and outputs, however.

### Digital I/O

Digital data can be both sent and received. It is also possible to program individual bits of the eight bit data lines as inputs and the rest as outputs. This is only possible with direct programming of the hardware register `$BFE301`.

Here we'll just look at using the entire port as input or output. There is also a device for this: the `parallel.device`. An extension must be made to the normal I/O structure in order to use this device. This extension has the following construction:

    Offset                 Name                  Contents
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    48                     PWBufLen              Length of the output buffer
    52                     ParStatus             Status of the device
    53                     ParFlags              Parallel flags
    54-61                  PTermArray            Termination mask
    
    The status byte contains the following status bits:
    
    Bit                    Name                  Meaning, if set
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    0                      PBUSY                 Printer busy
    1                      PAPEROUT              No more paper
    2                      PSEL                  Printer selected
    3                      RWDIR                 Data direction (0 = read, 1 = write)
    
    The following bits represent the parallel flags:
    
    Bit                    Name                  Meaning, if set
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1                      EOFMODE               EOF mode enabled
    2                      ACKMODE               Set this bit if you want to use ACK handshaking.
    3                      FASTMODE              High-speed mode. Will send out data as long as the BUSY signal is low.
    4                      SLOWMODE              Slow-speed mode for transfers to very slow printers.      
    5                      SHARED                Access possible for other tasks. Don't use with FASTMODE
    
If you want to read from the parallel port, the question arises as to how the receiver is to recognize the end of the transfer. It is possible to use a given byte sequence to stop the reception. This sequence is stored in the two long words of `TermArray`. This termination sequence is activated if bit 1 of the flag byte is set `(EOFMODE)` and the `SETPARAMS` command `(10)` is then called.

Please Note:

* Strobe functions as input data accepted from Amiga in input mode (similar to ACK* in output mode).
* Ack functions as input-data-ready from parallel device in input mode (similar to Strobe* in output mode).
